Advent of Code is an interactive coding challenge that runs from Dec 1-25. Participants earn two stars for solving problems each day.

In "src/main" you will find "kotlin", and all of the puzzle inputs labelled 'd{dayNo}.txt'. Within "src/main/kotlin" you will find Kotlin files labelled 'Day{dayNo}.kt', and within those are a main function, as well as 2 functions 'd{dayNo}p1' and 'd{dayNo}p2', representing the two problems a day. 

The solutions are designed to provide an answer in the quickest time possible (including writing, not just runtime), so they are not optimal efficiency or readability, but usually relatively brute force.

Enjoy!
